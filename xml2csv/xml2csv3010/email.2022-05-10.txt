Yes. For now any is to be looked at as SGE rotor and DV6.2 rotor xml file input. It may be glitchy for a datetime format that is different from the machine output of 6365 for SGE rotor and 6830 for DV6.2 rotor. See examples below.

SGE example: s1_top_view_20210101T001122.xml
DV6.2 example: outer_surface_220428T123456.xml

If the formats differ from these inputs then there is a good chance it might not work properly, for the time being.

I moved and renamed.

\\corp-fs01\CORP-PM\people\parthpatel\script-python\xml2csv\xmltocsv_any_prompts.py

Any=any xml input file format

Does what I did make sense?
