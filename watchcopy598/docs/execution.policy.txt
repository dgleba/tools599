I ran the following. I hope it sticks.


PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Do you want to change the execution policy?

I googled around and found this (you may have seen it too): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41117421/ps1-cannot-be-loaded-because-running-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system/49112322

See if this helps

I want to reword the email.

1.
On july 14th I installed the watcher and got.

Error:
PS C:\data\script\tools599\watchcopy598> .\watch598.ps1
.\watch598.ps1 : File C:\data\script\tools599\watchcopy598\watch598.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is
disabled on this system. For more information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

I ran this to address it:   ` Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

It was working for 4 days.

Now I get the same message that “running scripts is disabled on this system”

Is there something turning off script execution? Maybe Sophos or something?


2.
Ignore #2. I just realized that we can’t use robocopy as that would re-copy files qccalc removed. That may duplicate data in qc calc.

We have to copy only newly added files.
