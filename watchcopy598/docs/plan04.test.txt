for testing only..

We want to copy from A rather than move. We want to leave it functioning the way it does now during testing.
Leave the A folder untouched during testing.

A=calypso folder 
A2=copy of calyso folder for testing.
B=temporary transfer folder [interimfolder]
E=litmus C:\data\cmm\watchedoutput\litmus
C=full-copy  [general] C:\data\cmm\watchedoutput\general
D=QC Calc [qccalc] 

2021-07-minus = monthly? minus30days?  archive of full-copy

upon watcher notification...

copy only notified files (chr,fet,hdr) from A to A2.(robocopy)  (for testing we need to leave them in A)
move all from A2 to B (robocopy) 
sleep 2 sec.
copy chr,hdr from B to E  (robocopy)
sleep 2 sec.
copy all from B to C  (robocopy)
sleep 2 sec.
move all from B to D. (robocopy)


D will be altered by QC calc
E will be empty after litmus gets and deletes the files.
C will have all files.
