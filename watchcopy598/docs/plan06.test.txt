Plan06: revised - using temp folder to gather all three files chr,hdr,fet.



for testing only..

We want to copy from A rather than move. We want to leave it functioning the way it does now during testing.
Leave the A folder untouched during testing.

_____________


A=calypso folder 
not used. A2=copy of calyso folder for testing
B2=temporary transfer folder [C:\data\cmm\system\temp3file\`name-for-one-basename`]
B=temporary transfer folder [interimfolder]
E=litmus C:\data\cmm\watchedoutput\litmus
C=full-copy  [general] C:\data\cmm\watchedoutput\general
D=QC Calc [qccalc] 


copy only notified files (chr,fet,hdr) from A to B2.)  (for testing we need to leave them in A. In production we will move them.)
When all present. wait 10 seconds.
(Copy in testing) (move in production) A to B. delete B2.
sleep 2 sec.
copy chr,hdr from B to E  (robocopy)
sleep 2 sec.
copy all from B to C  (robocopy)
sleep 2 sec.
move all from B to D. (robocopy)
delete temp folder [C:\data\cmm\system\temp3file\`name-for-one-basename`] leaving [C:\data\cmm\system\temp3file\]
